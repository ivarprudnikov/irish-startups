Led by startup stalwart, mentor and founder Bill Liao, SOSventures European Venture Partner (also co-founder of CoderDojo and founder of WeForest.org), he is joined by Wayne Murphy Accelerator Manager, and Belfast based Diane Roberts from Xcell Partners running the programme.\n\nIn addition there is an impressive team of expert mentors with a wide range of international experience, who will offer invaluable and intensive mentoring and coaching to programme participants. \n \nThe accelerator also offers an innovative co-operative approach to the investment that the startups will gain and the equity they offer in return. \n\nIt will kick off in November 2015 with the programme’s first cohort of 10 teams. Each team will consist of 2-4 people who will have a product or idea almost ready for market. \nParticipants will receive £15k ($23K USD / €21K EURO) seed funding and in return will be expected to part with 8% equity investment. \n\nUniquely however, of that 8%, 2% will go towards a Founders’ Fund, which plans to generate shares in a pool made up of each company participating in the five year programme. The goal being that, if in the not too distant future, one or more of the startups has a significant exit - all those in the ‘pool’ will benefit.\n",

Led by startup stalwart, mentor and founder Bill Liao, SOSventures European Venture Partner (also co-founder of CoderDojo and founder of WeForest.org), he is joined by Wayne Murphy Accelerator Manager, and Belfast based Diane Roberts from Xcell Partners running the programme.\n\nIn addition there is an impressive team of expert mentors with a wide range of international experience, who will offer invaluable and intensive mentoring and coaching to programme participants. \n \nThe accelerator also offers an innovative co-operative approach to the investment that the startups will gain and the equity they offer in return. \n\nIt will kick off in November 2015 with the programme’s first cohort of 10 teams. Each team will consist of 2-4 people who will have a product or idea almost ready for market. \nParticipants will receive £15k ($23K USD / €21K EURO) seed funding and in return will be expected to part with 8% equity investment. \n\nUniquely however, of that 8%, 2% will go towards a Founders’ Fund, which plans to generate shares in a pool made up of each company participating in the five year programme. The goal being that, if in the not too distant future, one or more of the startups has a significant exit - all those in the ‘pool’ will benefit.\n",

According to the latest survey carried out by PWC (one of the leading global providers of company research & investing information)  in 2008, the Irish audio-visual sector is a key industry for growth valued at over five and a half million and employs over six thousand individuals. Its attractiveness to both local and international investors arises from a mix of high level expertise, skills and very competitive tax incentives.\nPort Pictures aims to attracting both local and foreign investors and talent while simultaneously helping to increase Ireland’s international competitiveness as a location for media productions.\nPort Pictures Limited plans to share its in-depth knowledge of the Irish market to intelligently develop and produce quality, innovative and intelligent content across a multitude of formats including feature films, documentaries, music videos and commercials. \nAlthough Port Pictures Limited was only founded in 2014, it will hugely benefit from the wealth of experience it’s founder Martina Niland brings in particular across the complex areas of finance, production and co-production, distribution and sales. Having worked in the Industry for over a decade, Martina has built an impressive network of industry professionals both here in Ireland and internationally and has co-produced features films with countries such as Canada (STAY, 2012), Germany (RUN & JUMP 2012) and Holland (MILO, 2011). To date, her most critically acclaimed production was John Carney's ONCE, which received the Oscar® for Best Original Song in 2008 and she has just completed production on John’s much anticipated new film, SING STREET, which will be released worldwide in 2016. \nPort Pictures Limited aims to nurture and develop these already existing relationships with talent, financiers, festivals, sales agencies and distributors in the years ahead.",

These functions interact intelligently producing considerable added value and knowledge giving real time insight on the status of a project or process. \r\nRaptor is entirely cloud based and built on scalable technology. It integrates with existing management tools and is designed to eliminate lack of clarity while empowering all stakeholders to contribute to the success of the project. \r\nOur unique integration of the traditionally fragmented facets of project & process management delivers a single adaptable and cost effective tool enabling lean and transparent reporting for task-based endeavors. The amalgamation of processes into a single workflow eliminates data re-entry, ingrains risk with schedule & gives accurate real time status. \r\nCore functionality is developed using c# .NET, SQL Server and hosted on MS Azure.

              "description": "The Irish Film Industry is booming.  According to the latest survey carried out by PWC (one of the leading global providers of company research & investing information)  in 2008, the Irish audio-visual sector is a key industry for growth valued at over five and a half million and employs over six thousand individuals. Its attractiveness to both local and international investors arises from a mix of high level expertise, skills and very competitive tax incentives.\nPort Pictures aims to attracting both local and foreign investors and talent while simultaneously helping to increase Ireland’s international competitiveness as a location for media productions.\nPort Pictures Limited plans to share its in-depth knowledge of the Irish market to intelligently develop and produce quality, innovative and intelligent content across a multitude of formats including feature films, documentaries, music videos and commercials. \nAlthough Port Pictures Limited was only founded in 2014, it will hugely benefit from the wealth of experience it’s founder Martina Niland brings in particular across the complex areas of finance, production and co-production, distribution and sales. Having worked in the Industry for over a decade, Martina has built an impressive network of industry professionals both here in Ireland and internationally and has co-produced features films with countries such as Canada (STAY, 2012), Germany (RUN & JUMP 2012) and Holland (MILO, 2011). To date, her most critically acclaimed production was John Carney's ONCE, which received the Oscar® for Best Original Song in 2008 and she has just completed production on John’s much anticipated new film, SING STREET, which will be released worldwide in 2016. \nPort Pictures Limited aims to nurture and develop these already existing relationships with talent, financiers, festivals, sales agencies and distributors in the years ahead.",

It is based on an end to end Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery platform.\r\nA typical use for Raptor is in the delivery of complex construction projects and coordinating the functions around an established production process.\r\nIt is an innovative Enterprise Management platform which comprises separate functions such as estimating, safety, human resources, scheduling and reporting. These functions interact intelligently producing considerable added value and knowledge giving real time insight on the status of a project or process. \r\nRaptor is entirely cloud based and built on scalable technology. It integrates with existing management tools and is designed to eliminate lack of clarity while empowering all stakeholders to contribute to the success of the project. \r\nOur unique integration of the traditionally fragmented facets of project & process management delivers a single adaptable and cost effective tool enabling lean and transparent reporting for task-based endeavors. The amalgamation of processes into a single workflow eliminates data re-entry, ingrains risk with schedule & gives accurate real time status. \r\nCore functionality is developed using c# .NET, SQL Server and hosted on MS Azure. Interfaces are built using the latest web and app development technologies.\r\n\r\n",

It is based on an end to end Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery platform.\r\nA typical use for Raptor is in the delivery of complex construction projects and coordinating the functions around an established production process.\r\nIt is an innovative Enterprise Management platform which comprises separate functions such as estimating, safety, human resources, scheduling and reporting. These functions interact intelligently producing considerable added value and knowledge giving real time insight on the status of a project or process. \r\nRaptor is entirely cloud based and built on scalable technology. It integrates with existing management tools and is designed to eliminate lack of clarity while empowering all stakeholders to contribute to the success of the project. \r\nOur unique integration of the traditionally fragmented facets of project & process management delivers a single adaptable and cost effective tool enabling lean and transparent reporting for task-based endeavors. The amalgamation of processes into a single workflow eliminates data re-entry, ingrains risk with schedule & gives accurate real time status. \r\nCore functionality is developed using c# .NET, SQL Server and hosted on MS Azure. Interfaces are built using the latest web and app development technologies.\r\n\r\n",

              "description": "The Irish Film Industry is booming.  According to the latest survey carried out by PWC (one of the leading global providers of company research & investing information)  in 2008, the Irish audio-visual sector is a key industry for growth valued at over five and a half million and employs over six thousand individuals. Its attractiveness to both local and international investors arises from a mix of high level expertise, skills and very competitive tax incentives.\nPort Pictures aims to attracting both local and foreign investors and talent while simultaneously helping to increase Ireland’s international competitiveness as a location for media productions.\nPort Pictures Limited plans to share its in-depth knowledge of the Irish market to intelligently develop and produce quality, innovative and intelligent content across a multitude of formats including feature films, documentaries, music videos and commercials. \nAlthough Port Pictures Limited was only founded in 2014, it will hugely benefit from the wealth of experience it’s founder Martina Niland brings in particular across the complex areas of finance, production and co-production, distribution and sales. Having worked in the Industry for over a decade, Martina has built an impressive network of industry professionals both here in Ireland and internationally and has co-produced features films with countries such as Canada (STAY, 2012), Germany (RUN & JUMP 2012) and Holland (MILO, 2011). To date, her most critically acclaimed production was John Carney's ONCE, which received the Oscar® for Best Original Song in 2008 and she has just completed production on John’s much anticipated new film, SING STREET, which will be released worldwide in 2016. \nPort Pictures Limited aims to nurture and develop these already existing relationships with talent, financiers, festivals, sales agencies and distributors in the years ahead.",

              "description": "The Irish Film Industry is booming.  According to the latest survey carried out by PWC (one of the leading global providers of company research & investing information)  in 2008, the Irish audio-visual sector is a key industry for growth valued at over five and a half million and employs over six thousand individuals. Its attractiveness to both local and international investors arises from a mix of high level expertise, skills and very competitive tax incentives.\nPort Pictures aims to attracting both local and foreign investors and talent while simultaneously helping to increase Ireland’s international competitiveness as a location for media productions.\nPort Pictures Limited plans to share its in-depth knowledge of the Irish market to intelligently develop and produce quality, innovative and intelligent content across a multitude of formats including feature films, documentaries, music videos and commercials. \nAlthough Port Pictures Limited was only founded in 2014, it will hugely benefit from the wealth of experience it’s founder Martina Niland brings in particular across the complex areas of finance, production and co-production, distribution and sales. Having worked in the Industry for over a decade, Martina has built an impressive network of industry professionals both here in Ireland and internationally and has co-produced features films with countries such as Canada (STAY, 2012), Germany (RUN & JUMP 2012) and Holland (MILO, 2011). To date, her most critically acclaimed production was John Carney's ONCE, which received the Oscar® for Best Original Song in 2008 and she has just completed production on John’s much anticipated new film, SING STREET, which will be released worldwide in 2016. \nPort Pictures Limited aims to nurture and develop these already existing relationships with talent, financiers, festivals, sales agencies and distributors in the years ahead.",
